	<p>
		Need to understand how to save only the startup that is listed on the page as a favorite. Right now I think I am saving each startup.

		Do you always run .innerHTML on a class?

		Is there a best practice for finding a random number? Sometimes am seeing math.round and sometimes math.floor. Sometimes seems like you need to add or subtract 1 at the end, sometimes not.
